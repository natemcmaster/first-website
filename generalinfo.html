hours are from 7:50 A.M. to 2:30 P.M.&nbsp; Students entering the building prior
to 7:30 A.M. are to remain in the front lobby until the bell sounds.&nbsp; <b>We
strongly encourage parents not to drop their students off before 7:30 A.M. since
there is no teacher supervision</b>.&nbsp; Students not involved in a supervised
after-school activity are to leave the building by 2:45 P.M.<p align="center"><font size="4"><b><u><a name="Attendance">Attendance</a></u></b></font><font size="1"><a href="#top">-
back to top</a></font><p align="left"><b><u>Absences
From School</u></b><p align="left">Satisfactory progress in school depends to a
large extent on regular attendance.&nbsp; Absences create problems for both
students and teachers.&nbsp; Students who are frequently absent get behind in
their schoolwork and tend to lose interest in school.<p align="left">All
absences are to be reported to the attendance office at <b>285-8590</b> each day
that your child will be absent.&nbsp; You are asked to leave a message on voice
mail between the hours of 3:30 P.M. and 7:30 A.M.&nbsp; If a message is not
left, a staff member will attempt to contact parents/guardians at home or at
work.&nbsp; If the parent/guardian does not call in and contact is not made, the
student must bring a note stating the dates of the absence and reason.&nbsp; <b>The
note should be brought to the office prior to school starting in the morning</b>.&nbsp;
If parent/guardian contact is not made, the absences will be recorded as
unapproved.<p align="left">Excused absences are given for the following
reasons:&nbsp; illness or injury, illness or death in the family, medical and
dental appointments, and family trips.&nbsp; Pre-excuses for anticipated
absences are to be requested in writing as far in advance as possible.&nbsp; For
such an absence, a pre-excuse slip is to be obtained from the office in the
morning before school and presented to the teacher.&nbsp; Make-up work is to be
requested at this time.&nbsp; If your student is absent for more than 7 days
during the school year because of illness, please provide a note from your
physician documenting the nature of the illness.<p align="left">According to
Minnesota statute (260.015), youths under 18 years of age must be in attendance
at school.&nbsp; If a student does not have lawful permission for being absent,
that student will be considered truant from school.&nbsp; A student who has
seven or more occurrences of unexcused absences will be considered truant in
accordance with state statute.&nbsp; Action taken by the school will include
filing a truancy petition with the county court of the student's
residence.&nbsp; Excessive absences, even with a parental excuse, may result in
detention, suspension, or the filing of a truancy petition in district court as
required by Minnesota law.<p align="left">Kellogg is a closed campus
building.&nbsp; Students must have one of the above mentioned parent/guardian
pre-approved excuses to leave the building.<p align="left">If a student becomes
ill during the schoo day, he/she is to report to the health office where
arrangements will be made for leaving school.&nbsp; Students are to call their
parent/guardian from the nurse's office, not the classroom.<p align="left"><b><u>Tardiness</u></b><p align="left">When
students arrive late in the morning, they are to report to the main office for
an admit slip.&nbsp; When a student is tardy for school for the third, fourth,
and fifth time an in school detention is assigned.&nbsp; On the sixth tardy a
full day of in school suspension will be assigned.&nbsp; Consequences for
tardies to class are determined by the individual teacher or teaching team.<p align="left">Please
remember that coming to class late is a distraction for both the teacher and the
class.&nbsp; Being on time to school is a very important habit to develop.<p align="left"><b><u>Make-Up
Work For Absences</u></b><p align="left">The first step in requesting make-up work
is to obtain your pre-excuse form from the attendance office.&nbsp; After
receiving this form, student may then request make-up homework by presenting
this form to their teacher.&nbsp; The teacher will determine if work is to be
made up before or after the absence.&nbsp; In case of an illness that extends
three days or more, parents may request assignments from their child's
teachers.&nbsp; It is expected that assignments will be available for the parent
to pick up at school 24 hours after the request is made.&nbsp; Two days for each
day absent is normally the time recommended for make-up work to be
completed.&nbsp; Please call the counseling office at 285-8707 to request
make-up work for unanticipated absences.<p align="center"><u><b><font size="4"><a name="Teams">Teams</a></font></b></u><font size="1"><a href="#top">-

will be denied any of the activities due to economic hardships.&nbsp; Families
that cannot afford all or part of the activity fee will have all or the
remainder of the fee picked up by the Kellogg PTSA or the Kellogg Student
Council.&nbsp; Please contact the main office or your child's Target teacher to

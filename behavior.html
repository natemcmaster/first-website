program.&nbsp; The purpose of the program is to assist students in improving
their behavior and to provide them with the opportunity to continue to make
academic progress through teacher-provided assignments.&nbsp; It is believed
that remaining in school is the best situation for a majority of students, even
though they may be having behavior problems.&nbsp; Therefore, the Behavioral
Learning Center is a positive alternative to out-of-school suspension.</p>

enforcement official.</p>
